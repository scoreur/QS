/**
 * \mainpage
 * libmidi is a very simple library created for reading and writing MIDI files. It
 * is designed to be quick to use and quick to learn.
 *
 * All interaction should be done through the MIDI::File class, which parses a MIDI file.
 * The data inside the MIDI::File class is then organized as if it were a normal MIDI file.
 *
 * That is, MIDI::File has a header (MIDI::Header) and a list of tracks (MIDI::Track).
 *
 * Each track then has a list of MIDI events.
 *
 * See the MIDI file specification for more information.
 * http://www.midi.org/techspecs/index.php
 *
 * The following sites also describe the MIDI file, but are easier to read
 * <ul>
 *  <li>http://253.ccarh.org/handout/smf/</li>
 *  <li>http://www.piclist.com/tecHREF/io/serial/midi/midifile.html</li>
